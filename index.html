                        <p class="card-text">The snake moves in a straight line and can change its direction using arrow keys or swipe gestures in touch-enabled devices. Whenever the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries. The player's objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as they can.</p>
