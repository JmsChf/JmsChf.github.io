                        <p class="card-text">The original version of the snake game was developed in 1976 by Gremlin Industries. It was a simple game where the player controlled a snake that moved around the screen, eating apples and growing longer with each apple consumed. The game ended if the snake collided with itself or the boundaries of the screen.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In the 1990s, the snake game gained popularity with the advent of mobile phones. It became one of the most popular games on early Nokia phones, commonly known as "Snake" or "Snake II". The gameplay remained similar to the original version, but the graphics improved and additional features were added, such as different levels of difficulty.</p>
